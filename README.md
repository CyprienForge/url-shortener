# URL Shortener

### Project brief

The main purpose is to provide a little tool to cut URL for myself, like TinyURL.
But with this project I wanted to show the hexagonal architecture with Symfony in a little project. Despite of the URL Shortener is healvy coupled with HTTP, I can use this architecture to postpone the very technical decisions and I can build a self-sufficient domain layer without any frameworks or any technologies.
